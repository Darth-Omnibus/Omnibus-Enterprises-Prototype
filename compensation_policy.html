        <h1>Omnibus Enterprises Compensation Policy</h1>
        <h2>(Revised)</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>Article I: Foundational Principles & Philosophy</h3>
        <h4>Section 1.1 Commitment:</h4> <p>Omnibus Enterprises is committed to a compensation system that reflects its core values: recognizing the intrinsic worth of every Agent's dedicated time, ensuring all Agents can live with dignity and security, operating with demonstrable fairness, and grounding its structure in rational justification consistent with Article III of the Bylaws.</p>
        <h4>Section 1.2 Equal Value of Time:</h4> <p>The fundamental unit of contribution recognized by the organization is the time an Agent dedicates to furthering the mission of Omnibus Enterprises. This time is valued equally across all Agents internally, aligning with the Corporation's flat, System-mediated operational structure.</p>
        <h4>Section 1.3 Living Wage Guarantee:</h4> <p>This policy is designed to ensure that compensation meets or exceeds a comprehensively defined Cost of Living (CoL) for each Agent and their dependents, enabling them to focus their best efforts on their work without undue financial stress.</p>
        <h4>Section 1.4 Global Standards:</h4> <p>Omnibus Enterprises operates with a global perspective, incorporating international benchmarks for minimum compensation and definitions of family structures to ensure fairness regardless of location.</p>
        <h4>Section 1.5 Rational Justification:</h4> <p>The structure and components of this policy are based on reasoned analysis of Agent needs, operational requirements, ethical considerations, and legal compliance, subject to periodic review and improvement.</p>

        <h3>Article II: Scope</h3>
        <h4>Section 2.1 Applicability:</h4> <p>This policy applies to all regular Agents (employees) of Omnibus Enterprises, regardless of role, location, or employment status (full-time or part-time, prorated accordingly).</p>
        <h4>Section 2.2 Exclusions:</h4> <p>This policy does not apply to independent contractors, vendors, or external service providers, whose compensation is determined by negotiated contracts based on the specific services rendered.</p>

        <h3>Article III: Core Compensation Components & Definitions</h3>
        <h4>Section 3.1 Internal Time Unit & Tracking:</h4> <p>Compensation is based on time worked, tracked internally in units of <strong>Work Hours</strong>. One Work Hour represents one hour of documented effort dedicated to Omnibus Enterprises activities. <strong>The recording and documentation of Work Hours shall primarily be managed through the Corporation's central algorithmic system ("the System") to ensure accuracy and consistency.</strong></p>
        <h4>Section 3.2 Standard Workload:</h4> <p>For purposes of calculating hourly rates from annual costs, the Standard Annual Workload is defined as <strong>2080 hours</strong>, equivalent to a 40-hour work week. Compensation for part-time Agents will be prorated based on their agreed-upon work schedule relative to this standard.</p>
        <h4>Section 3.3 Global Minimum Wage Floor (GMWF / <code>Rate_Min</code>):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Definition:</strong> The absolute minimum hourly rate paid by Omnibus Enterprises, set at the highest legally mandated national minimum wage globally, converted to US Dollars (USD).</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Determination & Updates:</strong> The Board of Directors, or its designee, shall review and update the GMWF rate at least annually, based on documented research of global minimum wage laws and official currency conversion rates. The methodology and sources used shall be recorded.</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensures baseline legal compliance in all jurisdictions and establishes a high ethical floor for compensation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Section 3.4 Comprehensive Cost of Living (CoL):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Purpose:</strong> To determine the annual cost required for an Agent and their dependents to live with dignity and security in their locality, enabling full participation in work and society.</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Geographic Area:</strong> CoL calculations will be based on standardized, recognized geographic areas (e.g., County, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the US; equivalent national/regional administrative divisions internationally) where the Agent resides.</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Dependents:</strong> Dependents are identified using the <strong>Omnibus Enterprises Global Standard for Dependents</strong> (see Section 3.5).</li>
            <li>(d) <strong>CoL Components:</strong> The Annual CoL (<code>Annual_CoL</code>) calculation includes, but is not limited to, the reasonable local cost of:
                <ul>
                    <li>i. <strong>Housing:</strong> Based on HUD Fair Market Rents (FMRs) or equivalent reliable local data for an appropriately sized dwelling (determined by number of dependents per Section 3.5).</li>
                    <li>ii. <strong>Nutrition:</strong> Cost of a healthy, balanced diet based on local food prices.</li>
                    <li>iii. <strong>Utilities:</strong> Electricity, heating/cooling, water, sewer, waste disposal.</li>
                    <li>iv. <strong>Connectivity:</strong> High-speed home internet (unlimited data), cellular phone plan (unlimited data).</li>
                    <li>v. <strong>Healthcare Access Funding:</strong> An allowance towards securing locally appropriate basic preventative and emergency medical/dental care or insurance premiums.</li>
                    <li>vi. <strong>Transportation:</strong> Costs associated with regular commuting and necessary local travel.</li>
                    <li>vii. <strong>Clothing & Personal Care:</strong> Budget for necessary apparel and hygiene items.</li>
                    <li>viii. <strong>Devices:</strong> Allowance for or provision of necessary work/personal interface devices (e.g., smartphone, computer) <strong>sufficient for reliable and effective interaction with the System,</strong> if not provided directly by OE.</li>
                    <li>ix. <strong>Savings/Contingency:</strong> A modest percentage allocated for unforeseen expenses and basic savings.</li>
                    <li>x. <strong>Insurance:</strong> Allowance for basic renter's/homeowner's insurance.</li>
                    <li>xi. <strong>Civic Expenses:</strong> Allowance for typical local taxes or fees not withheld from payroll.</li>
                    <li>xii. <strong>Education/Development:</strong> Allowance for basic professional development or dependent-related educational costs.</li>
                    <li>xiii. <strong>Reasonable Entertainment/Social Participation:</strong> A modest budget for cultural and social engagement.</li>
                    <li>xiv. <strong>Childcare:</strong> Allowance for necessary childcare expenses if applicable based on dependents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(e) <strong>Data Sources:</strong> CoL calculations will utilize reliable, publicly available data sources (e.g., MIT Living Wage Calculator, Numbeo, governmental statistics like BLS/Eurostat, HUD FMRs, recognized international cost-of-living indices) appropriate for the Agent's location. Preferred sources and calculation methodology will be documented and reviewed periodically.</li>
            <li>(f) <strong>CoL Rate (<code>Rate_CoL</code>):</strong> <code>Rate_CoL (USD/hour) = Annual_CoL / Standard Annual Workload (2080 hours)</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Section 3.5 Global Standard for Dependents:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Definition:</strong> Omnibus Enterprises adopts a maximally inclusive definition of "dependent" based on a review of global legal standards. This includes spouse, domestic partner, minor children, disabled adult children, and potentially other co-habiting relatives primarily reliant on the Agent for financial support, subject to reasonable verification.</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Determination & Updates:</strong> The specific standard and verification requirements shall be documented, approved by the Board, and reviewed periodically.</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Application:</strong> Used primarily to determine the appropriate scale for CoL components like Housing size and potentially adjust other variable costs (e.g., food, childcare).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Section 3.6 Local Average Income per Hour (AIpH / <code>Rate_AIpH</code>):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) <strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>estimate</em> of the average hourly wage across various employment sectors within the Agent's standardized geographic area, converted to USD.</li>
            <li>(b) <strong>Purpose:</strong> To allow compensation to reflect significantly higher prevailing wage levels in certain locations, <em>if</em> they exceed the calculated CoL Rate and the GMWF Rate.</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Determination:</strong> Estimated using the best available official data (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, national statistical offices). The methodology and sources will be documented.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Article IV: Compensation Calculation & Payment</h3>
        <h4>Section 4.1 Final Conversion Rate (<code>Rate_Final</code>):</h4> <p>The USD value assigned to one Work Hour for payroll purposes is determined as follows:<br>
        <code>Rate_Final (USD per Work Hour) = MAXIMUM of (Rate_CoL, Rate_Min, Rate_AIpH)</code></p>
        <h4>Section 4.2 Rationale for MAX Function:</h4> <p>This calculation ensures that the rate paid is always the highest of: the amount needed to cover the comprehensive Cost of Living (<code>Rate_CoL</code>), the highest global minimum wage (<code>Rate_Min</code>), or the estimated local average income (<code>Rate_AIpH</code>), thereby guaranteeing a living wage, global compliance, and reflecting higher local economic conditions when applicable.</p>
        <h4>Section 4.3 Payment Calculation:</h4> <p>Gross pay is calculated as:<br>
        <code>Gross Payment (USD) = Work Hours Recorded (via the System) * Rate_Final</code></p>
        <h4>Section 4.4 Payment Frequency & Method:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) Agents may elect a standard payment frequency from the following options: <strong>Monthly, Bi-Weekly, Weekly, or Daily.</strong> The chosen frequency will determine the schedule for calculating and disbursing payments, subject to payroll system capabilities and processing timelines.</li>
            <li>(b) Payments will be made via <strong>direct deposit</strong> to the Agent's designated bank account or through other standard, secure electronic funds transfer methods appropriate for the Agent's location (e.g., wire transfer).</li>
            <li>(c) <strong>Note on Payment Methods:</strong> To ensure security, transparency, auditability, and administrative efficiency consistent with nonprofit best practices, the Principle of Rational Justification, and integration with the System, Omnibus Enterprises utilizes electronic payment methods exclusively. Physical cash payments present significant logistical, security, and compliance challenges that are impractical for the organization to manage responsibly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Section 4.5 Deductions:</h4> <p>All legally required taxes and withholdings, as well as voluntary Agent contributions (e.g., benefits, retirement), will be deducted from Gross Payment.</p>
        <h4>Section 4.6 Overtime:</h4> <p>Overtime compensation, where applicable by law, will be calculated based on the Agent's <code>Rate_Final</code> in accordance with local regulations, based on Work Hours recorded via the System.</p>

        <h3>Article V: Expectation of Focused Effort</h3>
        <h4>Section 5.1 Commitment for Compensation:</h4> <p>Consistent with the organization's commitment to providing fair and secure compensation based on the equal value of time, Agents are expected to dedicate focused effort to assigned tasks and organizational responsibilities during their logged Work Hours. Compensation under this policy is contingent upon this commitment of focused time and effort towards furthering the Corporation's mission, as coordinated and tracked via the System.</p>
        <h4>Section 5.2 Contribution Effectiveness:</h4> <p>Expectations regarding the effectiveness of contributions, collaboration, adherence to intelligent behavior principles, and feedback processes are detailed in the Omnibus Enterprises Human Resources Policy and the Intelligent Behavior Policy. These aspects relate to the Agent's role and development within the organization but do not alter the <code>Rate_Final</code> defined in this Compensation Policy.</p>

        <h3>Article VI: Policy Review, Transparency & Compliance</h3>
        <h4>Section 6.1 Periodic Review:</h4> <p>This Compensation Policy, including the GMWF, CoL components and data sources, the Global Standard for Dependents, and AIpH estimation methods, shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors or its designated committee. Reviews will assess effectiveness, alignment with organizational principles, data source reliability, and compliance with law, ensuring adherence to the Principle of Rational Justification (Bylaws Article III).</p>
        <h4>Section 6.2 Transparency:</h4> <p>Omnibus Enterprises is committed to transparency regarding its compensation methodology. This policy document will be accessible to all Agents. While individual salary details are confidential, the methodology for calculation is open. <strong>The System may provide interfaces allowing Agents to view the specific data inputs (e.g., CoL location data, dependents used, current Rate_Min) contributing to their individual <code>Rate_Final</code> calculation.</strong></p>
        <h4>Section 6.3 IRS Reasonableness:</h4> <p>The organization maintains that compensation determined under this policy is "reasonable" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) guidelines, justified by the documented, needs-based CoL methodology, adherence to global minimums, the organization's unique egalitarian and global operational structure facilitated by the System, and the equal valuation of dedicated time. Compensation levels will be periodically reviewed against relevant external benchmarks as part of due diligence.</p>
        <h4>Section 6.4 Legal Compliance:</h4> <p>This policy is intended to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local wage and hour laws in all jurisdictions where Omnibus Enterprises employs individuals. Where local law mandates higher compensation or benefits than this policy provides, the local law shall prevail.</p>

        <h3>Article VII: Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>This policy provides guidelines for compensation at Omnibus Enterprises. It does not create a contract of employment or guarantee employment for any specific duration. Omnibus Enterprises reserves the right to amend or terminate this policy at any time, consistent with the amendment procedures outlined in the Bylaws, particularly Article XIII.</p>
