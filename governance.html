        <h1>Governance & Transparency</h1>

        <h2>Legal Status</h2>
        <p>Omnibus Enterprises is incorporated as a Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation in the State of Washington. We have applied for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and are awaiting determination. Upon approval, donations will be tax-deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>

        <h2>Board of Directors & System Oversight</h2>
        <p>The affairs of the Corporation are managed by its Board of Directors, which holds ultimate authority and responsibility for fulfilling the Corporation’s mission and upholding its principles. <strong>A critical function of the Board is exercising direct oversight, governance, and ethical direction of the Corporation’s central algorithmic coordination system (“The System”).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This relationship between the Board, the System, and the human Agents is intentionally designed as a robust framework for ensuring mission alignment and preventing undesirable outcomes.</strong> The Board defines the strategic objectives, ethical boundaries, and core operational parameters within which the System operates. The System, in turn, coordinates tasks and information flow among Agents based on these directives and its analysis of organizational needs. Agents execute tasks and provide vital feedback on both the work itself and the System’s performance.</p>
        <p><strong>This structure creates inherent checks and balances:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Board Authority:</strong> The Board retains the power to modify, constrain, or even halt System operations if they deviate from the mission or ethical guidelines (Bylaws Section 5.1).</li>
            <li><strong>Rational Justification:</strong> Changes to the System’s core logic require explicit justification and Board review, ensuring transparency and preventing opaque or mission-corrupting alterations (Bylaws Article III).</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Regular Organizational Health Assessments include specific evaluation of the System’s performance, alignment, and potential risks (Bylaws Section 5.6).</li>
            <li><strong>Human Feedback Loop:</strong> Agent interactions and feedback provide continuous real-world grounding for System performance and adaptation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This deliberate governance design aims to harness the efficiencies of algorithmic coordination while ensuring human oversight, ethical control, and steadfast adherence to the Corporation’s public benefit mission, actively safeguarding against runaway conditions or corruption of purpose.</strong></p>
        <p>The initial Sole Director is Darth Omnibus (Matthew Souto). (Bylaws Article V)</p>

        <h2>Governing Documents & Policies</h2>
